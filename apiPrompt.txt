""". Count them and provide two JSON-formatted lists of the top 5 words each.

Perform the analysis here using the provided text.txt. Keep "forest_entities" and "redundant_rude_words" separate in the results. Only list the top 10 occurrences with the word as the JSON key and its count as the JSON value.

Provide a JSON with key stats about the text in the attached {text.txt} in the format from attached {
    "above": 3,
    "customarily": 4,
    "is like": 43,
    "at a given time": 46,
    "annually": 24,
    "on the odd occasion": 45
  } Additionally, test the output to ensure it does not contain the strings "count" or "word," but actual keys and values.

Next step, offer a brief suggestion on improving the text based on word count in addition to jason:

If the count of the word "GDPR" is less than 1, suggest: "Even if you are not disclosing personal information, consider mentioning GDPR." If the GDPR count is 1 or more, acknowledge: "Thanks for promoting GDPR."
